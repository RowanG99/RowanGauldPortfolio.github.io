about_content: |
  I am a backend and devops engineer/developer that has experience in using modern and more mature technologies to solve problems within the context of software development and engineering. 
  I like to think that I don't just developer solutions, I engineer them. I am a firm believer that the software must not just work but it must work well, it needs to be tested thoroughly, optimized and refined. 
  I enjoy developing a variety of software, ranging from; scripts that automate processes, APIs, services, web applications and I dabble with software written in C such as interpreters, compilers and OS.
