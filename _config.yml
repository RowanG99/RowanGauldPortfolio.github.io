about_content: |
  I am a backend and devops engineer/developer that has experience in using modern and more mature technologies to solve problems within the context of software development and engineering. 
  I like to think that I don't just developer solutions, I engineer them. I am a firm believer that the software must not just work but it must work well, it needs to be tested thoroughly, optimized and refined. 
  I enjoy developing a variety of software, ranging from; scripts that automate processes, APIs, services, web applications and I dabble with software written in C such as interpreters, compilers and OS.

          After my first year as a software engineer/developer, I realised that I'd like to learn more about the software that is used to make most software, C.

          After completing the book "The C Programming Languages" by Brain Kernighan and Dennies Richie, I wanted to apply what I have learnt and used this book as a guide for creating an interpreter.

          Thinking about what type of software I'd like to make in the future and what my current tool box contains, I thought Golang would be a great addition.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
